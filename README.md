This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Challenge Instructions

Thanks for your interest in becoming a member of iFit's front end team! As part of the application process, we ask that you complete the following challenge.

## What do I do?

This repo includes a very basic initialization of the `create-react-app` framework, along with the challenge instructions.

Your task is to build out a single page section based on the provided designs (included below under Required Assets). Your work will be judged based on how well it matches the designs, how well you've implemented at least basic responsive functionality, and your code's cleanliness and structure.

In addition, we ask that you show off your state management skills by adding select functionality for each of the cards. When clicked, they should reflect the active state pictured in the designs (top left card, with increased box-shadow).

 It's okay to adjust any part of the initial project setup to fit your needs and desired workflow. Bonus points for showing off your animation chops!

## How do I submit?

Here's the ideal workflow:
- Fork this repository
- Make it look amazing
- Push your version up to a public repository
- Submit the link in your communications with our hiring department
- (Optional): host your code at a live URL and share that link, as well

## How long do I have?

Although there's no hard time limit, we ask that you shoot to complete the actual coding portion within 2 hours of starting (on your honor).

## Required Assets

All required images have been exported for your use and are included at the link below.

# Create React App Info

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
